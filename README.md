# Installfest
Install all the things!

In order to start being productive programmers, we need to set up our environments.

1. XCode: You've already done this!
2. Terminal: the Mac OS Command Line.
3. [Slack](https://slack.com): the chat client we'll be using in this course. Download the desktop + mobile client and sign into our Slack room.
